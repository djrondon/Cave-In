Cave-In: Bagman arcade machine game sequel (still alpha)

There was an arcade machine game from the early 80's where I spent a lot of coins, now I'm learning Red language I thought it was a good idea to try to imitate the game, just to learn while play, because I wanted for long time to play this game again but wasn't available, so I had no choice but to do it myself. Red lang allowed me to create the game from scratch, I never imagined it would be so easy & fun to make games, I enjoyed a lot as it has been a long time since I did it this way, I could hardly have done it with another language that was not human oriented. 

I know it does not have the quality of the true arcade game, but the goal is not to market it, but to learn, to play and share the code to others, so they can also learn in his way. In addition there are some known functional concerns on behavior, such guards to stop & wait for elevator on same floor (now they jump), and for sure will discover many more, so the development continues. It was a good input to see the available videos of the original game, by looking the guards behavior you could learn about it's moving algorithm.

Official sound support is not available at this time, so no sound is provided for now.

To run it just download/unpack the files & folders and click on cave.red file if you have the Red language toolchain in your path (yes it runs on interpreter, that's how powerful Red-lang is), otherwise click on cave executable file (not tested on Mac).

Have fun!
