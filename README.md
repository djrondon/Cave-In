Cave-In: [BagmanÂ®](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcVstQnHhSA) Arcade machine game sequel (still alpha as [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) lang itself)

![Test Image 0](/scenes/bagman.jpg)

There was an arcade machine game from the early 80's where I spent a lot of coins. As I'm learning Red language, I thought it would be a good training to design a similar game, just to learn while play, because I wanted to play again this game. Red lang allowed me to create the game from scratch, I never imagined it would be so easy & fun to make games (have I mentioned that wanted to play again?), I enjoyed a lot as it has been a long time since I did it this way (since my cobol epoch at 80's to be honest). As it was a lot of work to do for only a person, design everything and put it all to run together was a challenge, I could hardly have done it with another language that was not **human oriented** ðŸ˜ƒ. Yes, it really make everything a bit easier, I'm sure you would like to [try](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) it if you are, like me, tired of fighting against the tense syntax and semantics of traditional languages.

I know this game does not have the quality of the true arcade game, but the goal is not to market it, but to learn, to play and share the code to others, so they can also enjoy and learn in his way. In addition there are some known functional concerns on behavior, as for example elevators & kart excessive speed on Linux, and for sure will discover more, so the development continues slowly but surely.

Official sound support is not available at this time, (you're already aware that Red is alpha stage) so no sound is provided by now. I remember the sound effects & melody [Turkey in the Straw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr8QnkTwT_w) (ice cream truck song melody), some day music & sound will be available in Red and we could enjoy much more.

To run the game you need the [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) toolchain in your path, just download/unpack the files & folders and click on cave.red file. **Yes it runs on interpreter, that's only part of the magic on Red-lang**, otherwise you can compile your exe with `red -r -t [target OS] cave.red` or if you trust me, click on cave executable file (not tested on Mac & Linux). Whatever your OS is, you need to have the source/executable file in the main game folder to run the game.

Meet us at the [Red forums](https://gitter.im/red/red) and ask whatever you want to ask, here is the Red dev team ready for answer, and of course me too. Have fun! ðŸ˜‰
