Cave-In: Arcade machine game sequel (still alpha)

![Test Image 0](/scenes/bagman.jpg)

There was an arcade machine game from the early 80's where I spent a lot of coins. As I'm learning Red language, I thought it would be a good training to design a similar game, just to learn while play. Red lang allowed me to create the game from scratch, I never imagined it would be so easy & fun to make games, I enjoyed a lot as it has been a long time since I did it this way, I could hardly have done it with another language that was not human oriented.

I know it does not have the quality of the true arcade game, but the goal is not to market it, but to learn, to play and share the code to others, so they can also learn in his way. In addition there are some known functional concerns on behavior, such guards to stop & wait for elevator on same floor (now they jump), and for sure will discover many more, so the development continues. 

Official sound support is not available at this time, so no sound is provided by now.

To run it just download/unpack the files & folders and click on cave.red file if you have the Red language toolchain in your path (yes it runs on interpreter, that's how powerful Red-lang is), otherwise click on cave executable file (not tested on Mac).

Have fun!
